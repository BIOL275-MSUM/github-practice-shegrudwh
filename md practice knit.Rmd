## GitHub Practice for Quant Bio
#downloading packages

```
{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(readxl)      # load readxl, for reading Excel files
library(tidyverse)   # load tidyverse, for working with datasets
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
finches <- read_excel("finches_data.xlsx")

finches

glimpse(finches)
```

## Including Plots
#Historgram

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = finches,                     # use the finches dataset
  mapping = aes(x = beak_length,      # put beak length on the x axis
                fill = outcome)       # fill sets the color of the boxes
) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 14) +         # add the histogram, use 14 bins
  facet_wrap(~ outcome, ncol = 1) +   # outcome is the grouping variable
  guides(fill = FALSE) +              # don't show a legend for fll color
  labs(
    title = "Figure 1.",              # title
    x = "Beak Length (mm)",           # x-axis label
    y = "Number of Birds"             # y-axis label
  )
```

##Summarising Data
#Summarise by death and survive

```{r}
beak_length_grouped_summary <- 
  finches %>% 
  group_by(outcome) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(beak_length),
            sd = sd(beak_length),
            n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(sem = sd / sqrt(n),
         upper = mean + 1.96 * sem,
         lower = mean - 1.96 * sem)
```

##Print the results 

```{r}
beak_length_grouped_summary
```

##Bar plot
```{r}
ggplot(
  data = beak_length_grouped_summary,   # dont use the original finches dataset
  mapping = aes(x = outcome,            # survival on the x axis
                y = mean,               # mean beak length on the y axis
                fill = outcome)         # make died/survived different colors
) +
  geom_col() +                          # add columns
  geom_errorbar(                        # add error bars
    mapping = aes(ymin = lower,         #   lower 95% confidence limit
                  ymax = upper),        #   upper 95% confidence limit
    width = .3                          #   width of horizontal part of bars
  ) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +                # don't show a legend for fll color
  labs(
    title = "Figure 2.",                # title
    x = "Survival Outcome",             # x-axis label
    y = "Beak Length (mm)"              # y-axis label
  )
```

##ttest

```{r}

beak_length_died <-
  finches %>%                     # start with finches dataset
  filter(outcome == "died") %>%   # only include rows w/ outcome=died
  pull(beak_length)
```

```{r}
beak_length_died
```

```{r}
beak_length_survived <-
  finches %>% 
  filter(outcome == "survived") %>% 
  pull(beak_length)
```

```{r}
beak_length_survived
```

```{r}
t.test(beak_length_died, beak_length_survived)
```





You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
